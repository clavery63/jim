RAYCAST ENGINE by Chris Lavery

A pseudo 3D game engine written in C++ with the help of the Allegro library, designed to mimic the styles of Hovertank 3D, Catacomb 3D and Wolfenstein 3D.

The environment is created using a raycast algorithm on a 2D array, with sprites generated by seperate functions.  Next additions will include: sprites accurately positioned by z-value, moving sprites and texture mapping.

Keep in mind that this project is strictly for my own educational purposes, and not, in its current form, intended to power any full-fledged games.
